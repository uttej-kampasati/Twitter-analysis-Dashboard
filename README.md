Twitter Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains the project developed as part of my internship at Null Class. The goal was to create an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI to analyze Twitter data.

Project Overview
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of various Twitter metrics, helping users understand tweet performance through key metrics such as:

Impressions
Engagements
Engagement Rate
Likes, Retweets, and Replies

The dashboard is designed to offer insights into tweet engagement trends, helping users visualize the impact of specific tweet characteristics such as media content, hashtags, and user interactions.

Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes line charts, pie charts, and dual-axis charts for comprehensive data exploration.
Custom Filters: Users can filter tweets based on specific criteria, such as time of posting, word count, and engagement levels.
Top Tweet Identification: Highlights tweets with the highest engagement rate, allowing for focused analysis on the most impactful content.
